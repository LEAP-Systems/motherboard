# EEPROM

EEPROM for storing combinational logic for outputting seven segment byte information in correspondance with address selectors (A0-A7) which will be the outputs of the STP shift register.

For non-i2c eeprom chips we will need some number of shift registers to program EEPROM from the arduino.
